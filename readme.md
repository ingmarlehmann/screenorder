# Screenorder

A tiny utility to order screens in X automatically. 
Uses the edid of each screen to identify it.

If you're using `i3` it will reorder your workspaces automatically as well. 
This order can be manually overridden if needed.

## Installation

Put `screenorder.py` where you can find it or on your `PATH`.

## Running

Run the `screenorder.py` script. 
When running it will output the unknown screens, which can then be pasted into the config file.
